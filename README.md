Designed a supervised machine learning model for predicting the bitcoin value at a certain time 't' in the future given the historical data of bitcoin values and the current Twitter trend regarding bitcoins. The model uses Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) neural network for predicting the bitcoin values. It has been found that GRU follows the actual bitcoin values more closely than the other neural network models such as CNN, RNN and LSTM.
